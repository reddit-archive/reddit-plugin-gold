        <h2>REDDIT</h2>
        <h2>OFFICIAL GIVEAWAY RULES</h2>

        <p>reddit and its partners will be giving away prizes to reddit gold members! Please read these rules carefully as they govern our prize giveaways. By entering a giveaway, you agree that these rules will apply to you.</p>

        <h3>How to Enter</h3>
        <p>You don't need to buy anything to enter a giveaway or to win a prize. All eligible reddit gold members may participate in the giveaway. For more information about reddit gold membership, please see&#32;<a href="/gold/about">http://www.reddit.com/gold/about/</a>. The dates of the giveaways will be listed in the prize details below.</p>

        <h3>Other Ways to Enter</h3>
        <p>You can become a reddit gold member for one month by mailing a postcard to reddit c/o Wired, 520 Third Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. For more information, see&#32;<a href="/gold/about#postcard">http://www.reddit.com/gold/about#postcard</a>.</p>

        <h3>Prizes</h3>
        <p>We will describe giveaway dates, prizes and their approximate retail value&#32;<a href="#prize-details" onclick="$('#prize-details').toggle()">here</a>. Your odds of winning depend on the number of reddit gold members - for example, if there are 10,000 reddit gold members, the odds of winning any one prize would be 1 in 10,000. reddit may substitute prizes of equal or greater value if we believe it is necessary.</p>

        <div id="prize-details">

        <h3>How We Select Prize Winners</h3>

        <p>reddit and our partners are not responsible for (1) your entries, (2) your use of any prize, (3) your participation in a giveaway, or (4) anything else outside of our reasonable control. reddit reserves the right to cancel or change any giveaway, prize, or entry if we believe the giveaway is not being properly conducted or any entries are fraudulent. If this happens, we will do our best to pick winners from all eligible, non-fraudulent entries. You hereby release reddit and its partners from all liability of any kind relating to any giveaway or any prize.</p>

        <h3>Privacy and Legal</h3>
        <p>To enter a giveaway, you may be required to give reddit and its partners certain information such as your name, physical address and redditgifts usernames. We will use this information in accordance with&#32;<a href="/help/privacypolicy">our Privacy Policy</a>.
